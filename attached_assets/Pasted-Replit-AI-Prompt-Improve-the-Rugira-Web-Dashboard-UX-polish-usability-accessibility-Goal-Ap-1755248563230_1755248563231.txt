Replit AI Prompt — Improve the Rugira Web Dashboard (UX polish + usability + accessibility)

Goal
Apply the following UX/UI improvements to the Rugira dashboard. Keep the current tech stack and overall Swiss, clean look. No new backend work is required; where data is not yet available, use safe placeholders and make the UI resilient.

A. Global improvements

Consistency & spacing: Adopt an 8px spacing grid; harmonize card paddings, section gaps, and table row heights across all pages.

Typography: Use a clear hierarchy—H1 (page title), H2 (section titles), card titles, body text—with consistent sizes and weights. Ensure numbers use tabular figures so KPIs and table columns align nicely.

Color semantics: Keep green for positive, red for negative, amber for warnings; never rely on color alone—always pair with an icon or label (▲▼, ✓, !).

Accessibility: Meet WCAG AA contrast; minimum 14px body text; keyboard navigation for all interactive elements (focus states visible); aria‑labels on icons; chart descriptions for screen readers. Add a “Skip to content” link.

Time & currency: Persist the time range selector (e.g., 24h / 7d / 30d / YTD / custom) and base currency across pages, stored in local storage. Always show Last updated: HH:MM:SS UTC near the page header.

Real‑time indicator: In the top bar, add a tiny pulse “Live” dot when SSE is connected; when disconnected, show “Reconnecting…” and gracefully fall back to 5s polling.

Microcopy: Add short helper text under page titles explaining what the user can do here. Add tooltips for jargon (Sharpe, drawdown, slippage, KYT).

Notifications: Keep toasts minimal and actionable (e.g., “Bot started • View details”). Add a compact Notification Center flyout with filters (All, Errors, Compliance).

Danger actions: Any destructive action (Stop all bots, Delete user, Rotate key) must show a confirm dialog with a clear summary. For the Kill Switch, require typing PAUSE to confirm.

Empty states & skeletons: For each page/table/chart, show an encouraging empty state (what it is + primary CTA) and skeleton loaders while data fetches.

Performance: Virtualize long tables (Bots, Users, Alerts). Defer heavy charts below the fold until visible. Cache last successful data and show it instantly on revisit with a small “refreshed just now” label.

Global Search (⌘K / Ctrl+K): Provide a quick palette to jump to bots, exchanges, users, or help articles.

B. Overview page

KPI row: Make KPIs uniform (icon + label + big number + delta vs baseline). Ensure consistent currency and precision; thousands separators.

Charts: Add a time‑range control aligned right. Enable on‑chart hover tooltips (date, value, delta) and a light “event” annotation type (e.g., bot starts/stops).

Live feed: Group events by minute and type (Trade, Risk, Compliance). Each event shows bot name, symbol, concise message, and link to details.

Service tiles: Show API and Orchestrator status with a small heartbeat timestamp (e.g., “120s since last heartbeat”).

Acceptance: KPIs line up perfectly; charts respond to range changes; the feed streams in without layout jumps; service tiles never show stale “OK”.

C. Bots list & details

Table enhancements: Add column sorting; quick filters (Status, Exchange, Strategy); a search box; and “Saved views” (e.g., My Running Bots). Add a small sparkline P/L column for the last 24h.

Bulk actions: If multiple selected, allow Start, Stop, and Export.

Row badges: Status pill (Running/Stopped/Starting/Error) + last heartbeat age (e.g., “42s ago”).

Details view tabs:

Runtime: show positions, open orders, and a tailing log panel with auto‑scroll toggle and copy button.

Config: group params into Strategy and Risk; lock fields in MVP but display version + “last changed by”; include a diff link when history is available.

Performance: add ROI, P/L, win rate, Sharpe, max DD with mini trendlines; Export CSV button.

Compliance: show bot‑scoped alerts and audit trail with filters.

Start/Stop confirmations: Summarize impact (e.g., open orders will be canceled on stop).

Acceptance: Sorting and filters persist per user; Start/Stop require confirmation; details tabs are responsive and fast.

D. Strategies

Card clarity: For each template card, keep a short description, risk level (low/medium/high), expected holding timeframe, and typical markets.

Configure flow: When clicking Configure, show a clean form with validation, inline helper text (e.g., “Lookback: periods”), and a preview of expected behavior (simple textual summary is fine).

Profiles: Allow saving named parameter sets (“Arb‑tight‑v1”). Show “last edited by” and a duplicate button.

Acceptance: Users can browse, configure, and save profiles without leaving the page; validation is clear and friendly.

E. Exchanges

Connections table: Columns: Exchange, Alias, Permissions (Read‑only/Trade‑only/Full), Environment (Paper/Live), Status (Connected/Disconnected/Error), Last Verified, Actions.

Actions column: Buttons for Test, Rotate Key, Refresh, Delete—each with confirmation.

Add connection wizard: Steps—Select Exchange → Enter API key/secret → Permission reminder (trade‑only recommended) → Test → Save. Show clear success/failure.

Security microcopy: “Never share keys. Disable withdrawals. Restrict IPs if your exchange allows it.”

Acceptance: Status updates clearly; rotate/test flows are obvious; wizard prevents saving until a successful test.

F. Compliance

Alerts inbox: Filters by severity, reason, bot, time; bulk acknowledge with note.

Alert details: Event timeline (what/when/by whom), recommended action, link to impacted bot/order, and audit trail entry id.

Audit log tab: Tenant‑scoped log with export (CSV) and filters (actor, action, date).

Acceptance: Operators can triage alerts quickly and export an audit slice for a timeframe.

G. Reports

Tabs: Performance, Operational, Risk Analysis.

Controls: Time range + tenant/bot multiselect that persists.

Charts: Provide tooltips, legend toggles, and export to CSV (and PNG if easy).

Data integrity: Each KPI tile links to its underlying dataset slice (e.g., “View trades behind this P/L”).

Acceptance: Exports work; charts remain readable on narrow screens; controls persist across visits.

H. Backtesting

Runs table: Columns—Strategy, Date Range, Status (Queued/Running/Completed/Failed with progress %), Total Return, Sharpe, Max DD, Actions.

Results page: Equity curve, metrics, monthly returns; button “Promote to bot” pre‑fills the Create Bot wizard with these params.

Compare tab: Allow selecting 2–3 completed runs to compare side‑by‑side.

Acceptance: Users can create, monitor, export, and promote a backtest with no ambiguities.

I. Monitoring

System overview: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Active Connections, Queue Depth—each with Normal/Warning/Critical thresholds and tiny last‑5‑minutes sparkline.

Service status: API, Orchestrator, Market Aggregator—status + last heartbeat + link to logs.

Active alerts: Top of page shows current actionable alerts with severity.

Acceptance: At a glance, operators know if the system is healthy; all status tiles reflect fresh data.

J. Admin

Users table: Add column sorting (by role, status, last login). Actions: Edit, Reset MFA, Impersonate (read‑only), Delete.

Add user dialog: Invite via email, assign role, optional country, optional subscription tag.

Security tab: Tenant‑level toggles—MFA required, session timeout, password rules (UI only for now).

Maintenance tab: Link to incident runbook and planned maintenance banner controls.

Acceptance: Admins can manage users quickly; security/maintenance settings are discoverable and safe.

K. Help

Tabs: FAQ, Guides & Tutorials, Contact Support.

Search: Simple client‑side search over FAQ entries.

FAQ items: Expandable accordions; tag chips (getting‑started, trading, technical).

Acceptance: Users can self‑serve most questions; “Contact Support” contains a clear mailto: and optional form.

L. Final polish & QA checklist

All pages show Last updated (UTC) and respect the global time range.

No layout shift when live data arrives (reserve heights).

No console errors or unhandled promise rejections.

Keyboard can reach every action; focus ring visible; Escape closes modals.

Charts and tables are responsive down to 1280px gracefully.

No mixed content; CSP violations resolved; no third‑party trackers.

Empty states exist for every major list/table/chart with a helpful CTA.

All destructive actions require confirmation; the Kill Switch requires typing PAUSE.

Tooltips added for jargon; deltas always show sign (±) and time basis (vs yesterday / vs last week).

Numbers formatted with thousands separators; currency shown consistently; percent precision consistent (e.g., 1 decimal place).

Please implement the above, then summarize what changed per section (A–L) and list any items you stubbed due to missing backend data.
