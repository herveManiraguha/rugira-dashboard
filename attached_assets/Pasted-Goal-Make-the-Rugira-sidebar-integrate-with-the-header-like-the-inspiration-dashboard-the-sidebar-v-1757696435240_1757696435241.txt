Goal
Make the Rugira sidebar integrate with the header like the inspiration dashboard: the sidebar visually continues up into the header (a seamless “band”), with a clean seam and a discoverable collapse control.
Do not change labels, order, wording, icons, routes, or colors. This task is only about the intersection between the header and the sidebar.

1) Seamless band into the header

Extend the sidebar background (the existing very light blush) all the way to the top of the page, so it is visible behind the header on the left.

Reserve a left gutter inside the header equal to the current sidebar width (expanded and collapsed) so the header’s content never overlaps this band.

Draw a continuous 1‑pixel vertical divider at the sidebar’s right edge that runs through both the header and the page body. Use the same subtle divider tone already used in the app.

2) Alignment & spacing

Keep the header height exactly as it is.

Align the breadcrumb/title row so that its left edge lines up with the content area, not the sidebar; when the sidebar collapses, this alignment stays perfect.

Ensure the top-left brand shield and any existing header icons remain in their current positions relative to the content area.

3) Collapse / expand control at the seam

Place the sidebar collapse/expand chevron at the top seam inside the header, vertically centered with the header.

The button sits on the blush band and uses the current neutral icon color; on hover it uses the existing hover state and on focus it shows the thin brand‑red outline used elsewhere.

Animate the gutter/rail width change smoothly (about 150–180 ms) so the breadcrumb doesn’t “jump.”

4) Active-state continuity

Keep the existing active vertical red rail on the sidebar. Make sure it visually lines up with the divider at the header seam so the left edge feels instrument‑grade precise.

No other visual changes to items, badges, or labels.

5) Scroll & sticky behavior

The header stays sticky. The sidebar scrolls independently as it does now.

The blush band and divider remain visible across the header while scrolling.

Preserve the deep‑red overscroll background outside the app shell; do not modify.

6) Responsive behavior

Expanded: header reserves a gutter equal to the expanded sidebar width; blush band fills that area.

Collapsed: header gutter shrinks to the collapsed width; blush band and divider adjust accordingly.

Tablet/mobile: when the sidebar becomes a drawer, remove the header gutter and hide the blush band; the drawer still shows the blush background when opened.

7) Accessibility & focus

The seam toggle is keyboard‑focusable and announced (“Collapse sidebar” / “Expand sidebar”).

Maintain existing contrast ratios; no new colors introduced.

Acceptance criteria

The sidebar visually continues into the header as a left blush band with a continuous divider.

The breadcrumb and header actions remain exactly where they are relative to the content area.

Collapse/expand is triggered from the header seam and animates without layout jitter.

No changes to nav labels, iconography, routes, counts, or copy.

Works in expanded, collapsed, and mobile drawer states with correct sticky behavior.
