TASK — Modernize Rugira UI (Keep colors; refine surfaces, depth, motion)

Design North Star

Swiss-clean, quiet confidence. Low noise, high clarity.

Fewer visible lines, more negative space, and precise micro-motion.

Keep the current color palette; adjust only usage (no new hues).

1) Visual Foundation

Spacing scale: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48. Use bigger gaps between groups (24–32), tighter within components (8–12).

Typography: Headings semibold, body regular; increase heading–body contrast via size/spacing, not color. Line-height airy (1.4–1.6).

Color usage (keep existing colors):

Use green strictly for positive metrics and “good” statuses; red only for negatives/alerts.

Neutrals do the heavy lifting. Prefer subtle neutral text for secondary info (60–70% opacity).

Borders vs depth:

Replace most card borders with subtle elevation and a faint hairline divider inside the card header only.

Default card: no border, soft shadow (barely-there), 12–16px radius.

Use a thin 1px neutral border only where layout needs hard separation (tables, drawers).

Shadows (two levels only):

Level 1 (cards): very soft ambient.

Level 2 (popover/modals): slightly stronger; still soft edges. No harsh drop shadows.

Iconography & badges:

Use stroke-style icons consistently. Badge colors stay, but make badges lighter—solid text + pale background pill.

2) Navigation & Layout

Sidebar:

Keep section labels (BUILD / RUN / GOVERN / SYSTEM) but make them smaller, uppercase, 60% neutral, and add 16px spacing above each section.

Active item: pale background pill + bold label; indicator bar only 2–3px wide.

Offer a collapse state that shows only icons; on hover, a fly-out shows labels.

Top bar:

Consolidate environment/status into a single compact area: Tenant selector, “Paper” chip, “OK” chip, bell.

Show Last updated with a small refresh icon; on click, refresh and animate a quick spinner.

3) Cards & Key Metrics

Stat cards (Overview, Reports):

Each stat card includes a tiny sparkline (muted neutral) behind the main number for trend context.

Secondary deltas (e.g., “+5.2% vs last month”) in smaller text, neutral color with a tiny up/down arrow; use green/red text only for the sign, not the whole sentence.

Align iconography to the top-right, faint.

Content cards:

More white space (20–24 padding). Title row with a subtle hairline divider below; body area free of strong lines.

Use “Export” as a small ghost button with icon; avoid heavy buttons inside cards unless primary action.

4) Tables & Lists

Row density: Comfortable by default; compact option in table toolbar.

Row styling: No outer gridlines; just a light row divider. On hover, raise the row very slightly (shadow level 1) and tint background by 2–3%.

Status first: Left-aligned colored status dot + label. Use consistent wording (“Running”, “Stopped”, “Error”).

Batch actions: When rows are selected, reveal a slim sticky action bar at the bottom.

Empty/zero states: Replace bare empties with short copy, a tiny icon, and one primary action.

5) Filters, Search, and Tags

Filters live above content in a single slim bar with compact chips.

Active filters appear as pale chips with an “x”; clicking clears. Provide a “Reset” ghost button to the far right.

Search fields use quiet placeholders; on focus they gently expand in width (motion ≤ 160ms).

6) Buttons & Interactions

Primary buttons: minimal fill, smooth corners (12–16). Only one primary per view.

Secondary/tertiary become ghost or subtle outline; keep palette colors, lower emphasis.

Hover/press states rely on opacity/elevation, not color shifts.

Replace the floating blue FAB with:

Desktop: top-right “Create…” button group per page.

Mobile: keep a single FAB.

7) Charts (keep colors; refine presentation)

Reduce gridline contrast; use thin, soft grid.

Tooltips: compact, numeric with consistent decimals (e.g., 2 dp); show delta vs previous point subtly.

Legends: move inside the chart corner; smaller, neutral labels with color dots.

Add tiny baseline markers (e.g., $0, target lines) as faint hairlines.

8) Feedback & System States

Alerts/Compliance lists: Use a colored left border per severity (green/amber/red), neutral card body, and clear status pill (“Open”, “Acknowledged”, “Resolved”).

Toasts: top-right, low-contrast background, auto-dismiss. Never cover primary controls.

Skeletons: For graphs/tables, show skeleton shimmers for ~400–800ms on load/refresh.

9) Motion & Micro-interactions (subtle, purposeful)

Global timing: 120–160ms for most UI; 200–240ms for overlays/drawers.

Easing: standard ease-out on entrances, ease-in on exits; no bounce.

Cards, rows, and chips get 2–4px translate/scale at most on hover to feel responsive, not “gamey”.

On successful actions (save, connect), show a brief checkmark micro-animation in place.

10) Page-Specific Polishing

Overview

Add micro-sparklines in each KPI card; unify card heights.

Portfolio & P&L charts: soften grid, smaller legends, consistent y-axis currency formatting.

Bots

Add small platform icons next to exchange names.

Make Error rows lightly tinted; the “…” menu becomes visible on hover only.

Top filter chips for Running/Stopped/Error + exchange names; add “Clear filters”.

Exchanges

Connection cards: top-right compact status chip (“Connected”, “Error”). API usage bar thinner, with soft rounded ends.

For errors, show a single-line tip (“Check API key…”) with a discreet “Fix” action.

Strategies

Each tile gets a quiet header bar with the strategy icon; advantage/consideration lists use minimal bullets and shorter copy. “Popular / Low Risk” tags become pale compact pills.

Backtesting

Results card: big headline metrics (Total Return, Sharpe, Max DD) in a clean 3-up row.

Below, keep the equity curve and monthly returns; reduce bar saturation; add a quick “Compare” toggle.

Monitoring

Status grid uses colored indicator bars but lighter fills; labels under each metric in neutral text.

Trend panels (CPU/Memory, Network/Disk) reduce line thickness and grid weight; add “Last 15m / 1h / 24h” quick toggles.

Reports

Make the “7 Days” range selector a segmented control (7D/30D/90D/Custom).

Performance by Bot: limit y-axis labels, add value labels on hover only.

Compliance

Alerts list with severity left border, clear “Open/Ack/Resolved” pill, and a compact filter row (Severity, Bot, Time).

“View Details” becomes the sole emphasized action; avoid stacking equal-weight buttons.

Admin

User avatars circular; subscription pill with soft color. Show last login as relative time (“2d ago”) with exact time on hover.

Help

Knowledge base search gets a quiet hero area: large field, subtle shadow, small helper text (“Try: connect Binance”).

FAQ accordions: increase vertical rhythm; chevrons rotate smoothly.

11) Copy & Microcopy

Prefer short, neutral, factual labels. Avoid exclamation points.

Consistent capitalization (Title Case for nav/pages; Sentence case for controls).

Confirmations are calm and brief (“Connection saved”).

12) Acceptance Checklist

No new colors introduced; palette usage refined only.

Cards mostly borderless with soft elevation; tables keep thin dividers.

Hover/focus/press feedback everywhere; timing ≤ 160ms.

KPI cards include micro-sparklines; legends and tooltips are compact and consistent.

Filters always visible as compact chips; easy to clear.

Empty/skeleton states present and helpful.

Floating FAB removed on desktop; creation actions live top-right.

Error/critical states are visible but not loud; left-border pattern used consistently.
