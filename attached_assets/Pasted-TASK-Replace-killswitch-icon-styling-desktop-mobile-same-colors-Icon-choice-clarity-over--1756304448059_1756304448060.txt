TASK — Replace killswitch icon & styling (desktop + mobile, same colors)

Icon choice (clarity over the current “ban” symbol)

Use a Stop Octagon as the base mark (international “stop” shape).

Preferred: Octagon with an “X” inside (stroke).

Acceptable alternates if needed: Octagon alone, or Square-Stop.

Avoid: circle-slash (means “not allowed”), power symbol (means on/off, not emergency stop).

Visual style (match Rugira’s refined, stroke-first language)

Default container: subtle pill/lozenge, pale red wash (very light), soft shadow level-1, 12–14px radius.

Icon treatment: stroke-only, 1.75–2px weight, corners slightly rounded.

Sizing: 32–36px icon inside a 40–44px container (desktop). On compact toolbars, 28px inside 36px.

States

Safe (idle)

Container: neutral wash (very light grey).

Icon stroke: mid-neutral (not red yet).

Tooltip: “Kill switch — hold to stop all trading”.

Hover / Focus

Container: pale red background; subtle elevate +1; cursor shows “danger/stop”.

Icon stroke: brand red.

Armed (press-and-hold in progress)

Show a radial progress ring around the container (1200–1500 ms).

Copy on hover: “Hold to confirm…”.

Triggered

Container: solid brand red; icon becomes white X in octagon.

Brief “tick + fade” micro-animation (≤160 ms).

Toast: “Trading halted. All bots stopped.”

Disabled (nothing to stop / no perms)

Container: neutral; icon 40% opacity; tooltip “Unavailable”.

Micro-interactions

Timing: 140–180 ms for hover/focus; 200–240 ms for modal/confirm.

Easing: ease-out in; ease-in out.

No bounce; 1–2px translate only.

Accessibility & copy

ARIA label: “Emergency kill switch — hold to stop all trading”.

Keyboard: Shift + K triggers hold-to-confirm flow.

Confirmation modal (after hold completes): title “Stop all trading?”, primary “Stop now”, secondary “Cancel”; note: “Halts all bots and new orders. Open orders remain per venue rules.”

Placement

Keep it in the top-right status cluster (next to bell).

Add a thin left divider to separate it from routine status controls (Paper/OK/bell).

In pages with dense actions (e.g., Bots), optionally mirror a small text link in the page header: “Stop all (kill switch)”.

Color tokens (use existing palette; don’t introduce new hues)

Neutral strokes/text: your 60–70% neutral.

Pale red wash: your lightest brand-red tint for backgrounds.

Brand red for emphasis and the Triggered fill.

Acceptance checklist

Icon is instantly read as STOP/EMERGENCY, not “ban”.

Default state is calm; danger only on hover/armed/triggered.

Press-and-hold prevents accidental taps; clear feedback ring.

Works at 100% zoom on laptop header without crowding; readable at 28–36px.

Tooltip, ARIA label, keyboard shortcut, and toast are present and consistent.
