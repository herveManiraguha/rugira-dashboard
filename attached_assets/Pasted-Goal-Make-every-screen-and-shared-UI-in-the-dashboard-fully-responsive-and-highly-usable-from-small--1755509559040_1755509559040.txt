Goal
Make every screen and shared UI in the dashboard fully responsive and highly usable from small phones to wide desktops, without changing frameworks or auth/session behavior. Keep the Swiss, clean aesthetic and light theme.

Context (from replit.md)

Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, Tailwind, shadcn/ui (Radix), TanStack Query.

Backend: Express (TS) with WebSocket (ws) + SSE fallback, Drizzle ORM + Neon/Postgres, connect-pg-simple sessions.

Auth: mock login (demo), session storage for demo, real cookies for prod (.rugira.ch, Secure, SameSite=None).

Branding: Rugira Swiss shield logo, Swiss red #E10600 and green #1B7A46.

Routing: /login is entry; root redirects to /login; after login go to /overview.

Do not touch domain blocking, security headers, or CORS allow-list.

Guardrails (do NOT change)

Keep frameworks, routing, auth/session, security headers, domain rules exactly as they are.

No third-party trackers, no analytics changes.

Do not remove existing a11y attributes or SSE/WebSocket behavior.

Tailwind breakpoints (use mobile-first)

sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1280px, 2xl: 1536px.
Confirm tailwind.config.js uses defaults; if not, align to these.

A) Global shell & layout

Header

On lg+: keep full header.

On md: compress secondary actions into a “More” menu (overflow).

On sm: show logo + hamburger; move user/profile, Environment chip (Paper/LIVE), and Kill Switch into the overflow sheet.

Ensure focus states and aria-labels for all icon buttons.

Sidebar (nav)

lg+: persistent sidebar.

md: collapsible.

sm: off-canvas drawer with overlay, focus trap, ESC to close, swipe-to-dismiss if easy.

Keep SPA fallback (no 404 on refresh).

Footer

xl+: multi-column.

sm/md: stacked sections (accordion style).

Typography & spacing

Use an 8px spacing grid; scale type with clamp() or Tailwind responsive utilities.

Numbers use tabular figures for aligned KPIs.

No layout shift

Reserve heights for KPIs, charts, tables; show skeletons during load.

Live updates (WS/SSE) must not shift surrounding layout.

B) Core components

Environment chip (Paper/LIVE)

Compact pill with dot + label; truncate gracefully; tooltip clarifies meaning.

On sm, move into overflow menu; on lg+, keep visible.

Kill Switch

Visible on lg+; moves into overflow on sm/md.

Modal becomes full-screen sheet on small screens with clear confirm zone.

Tables (Bots, Users, Alerts, etc.)

sm/md: switch to card rows (label:value pairs) or allow horizontal scroll inside a container with sticky header + “Scroll →” hint.

lg+: normal table with sticky header; if crowded, add a column chooser.

Keep status chips and primary action visible without extra scrolling.

Virtualize very long lists if jank appears.

Charts (equity, drawdown, latency)

Responsive wrappers with fixed aspect ratio; legends collapse to a dropdown on sm/md.

Tooltips must not overflow; values readable at 320px width.

Forms & dialogs

sm/md: dialogs become full-screen sheets with large CTAs; inputs stack; inline errors below fields.

Touch targets ≥44×44px; date/time pickers thumb-friendly.

Notifications

Toasts compact; don’t overlap critical controls on small screens.

C) Page-by-page adjustments

/login: single column; big inputs; error text readable; “Back to rugira.ch” link stays visible.

/overview:

KPIs wrap: 1/row (sm), 2/row (md), 3–4/row (lg+).

Live feed → compact cards on sm; reserve height to avoid jump.

Charts responsive with range control dropping into a compact select on sm.

/bots (list + details):

Filters collapse into a top drawer on sm; saved views accessible from overflow.

Details tabs → segmented control with horizontal scroll on sm.

Runtime panel logs: fixed height container with internal scroll (no page jump).

/strategies:

Gallery → single-column list on sm; editor stacks parameter groups; helper text concise.

/exchanges:

“Add connection” wizard uses stepped layout; test result block remains readable on sm.

/compliance & /reports:

Filters collapse; tables follow table rules above; export buttons short labels.

/backtesting:

Form stacks; results charts responsive; compare view becomes stacked charts on sm.

/monitoring:

Metric tiles wrap; long labels truncate with tooltip.

D) Accessibility & performance

A11y: WCAG AA contrast; visible focus; keyboard-reachable; aria/roles on icon-only buttons; respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Performance: lazy-load heavy charts below the fold; responsive images; keep CLS ~0.

Cross-browser: Chrome, Safari, Firefox latest; iOS Safari; Android Chrome.

E) Acceptance Criteria (must all pass)

No horizontal page scroll on sm/md for primary content (tables may scroll inside their container with a visible hint).

Navigation works at all breakpoints (drawer on sm, collapsible on md, full on lg+).

Tables readable on sm (card/h-scroll) and fully featured on lg+.

Charts responsive, tooltips legible, no clipping at 320px.

Forms usable on mobile (targets ≥44px; errors readable).

Live updates do not cause layout jumps (reserved heights + skeletons).

A11y: keyboard nav OK, focus visible, prefers-reduced-motion respected.

Lighthouse Performance ≥90 (mobile & desktop) on /overview and one detail page; no console errors.

Auth/session untouched; domain blocking/CSP/CORS unchanged.

F) Deliverables

Implemented responsive styles/layouts as above across all pages.

RESPONSIVE_NOTES.md with: breakpoints, components refactored, known limits, and how to toggle “card mode” for tables.

A short QA screenshot set (or small screen-recordings) for sm, md, lg on: /login, /overview, /bots, /exchanges, /reports.

Optional: a “Density” toggle (Comfortable/Compact) applied at lg+ only.

G) Quick QA matrix (run and attach in notes)

Viewports: 360×640, 390×844, 768×1024, 1024×768, 1280×800, 1440×900.

Devices: iPhone 13/14, iPad (portrait & landscape), Pixel 6, small laptop, 1080p desktop.

Browsers: Chrome, Safari, Firefox; iOS Safari, Android Chrome.

Important: Do not modify authentication/session logic, security headers, domain blocking, or CORS. Keep /login → /overview redirect and session persistence exactly as is.
