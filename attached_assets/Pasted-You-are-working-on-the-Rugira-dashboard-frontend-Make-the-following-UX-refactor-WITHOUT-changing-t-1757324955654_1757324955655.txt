You are working on the Rugira dashboard frontend.

Make the following UX refactor WITHOUT changing the existing API contracts or business logic:

1) HEADER REWORK
- Replace the current header controls with four logical clusters:
  (A) Brand + Context chips:
      - Three chips in one row: Organization ▸ Portfolio ▸ Mode
      - Each chip opens a single dropdown. Mode chip offers Live/Paper/Demo.
      - Switching to Live requires a confirm dialog with a red warning.
      - Show the current selection in the chip label.
  (B) Filters cluster:
      - Time range selector (24h / 7d / MTD / YTD) and the existing attribution dropdown.
      - Keep Export near the time range selector with a consistent button style.
  (C) System status cluster:
      - Single compact status chip (green/amber/red). Clicking opens the existing infra/health popover.
  (D) User cluster:
      - Omni-search button (Cmd/Ctrl+K), Notifications (with count), Help, Profile avatar.

- The header must be keyboard navigable and responsive. Provide clear focus rings.

2) SIDEBAR IMPROVEMENTS
- Keep existing groups but ensure headings are visible in expanded mode:
  Build: Venues, Strategies, Backtesting
  Run: Bots, Monitoring
  Govern: Reports (rename to “Analytics” everywhere in UI), Compliance
  System: Admin, Help
- In collapsed mode, show icons only but add rich tooltips (title + one-line description).
- Add an optional Favorites section at the top (render if user has pinned items).

3) ICON SYSTEM
- Replace current mixed icons with Lucide (https://lucide.dev).
- Use outline style only, 24px grid, ~1.5px stroke, consistent sizing.
- Map screens to icons:
  Overview: activity
  Venues: building-2
  Strategies: beaker
  Backtesting: history
  Bots: bot
  Monitoring: monitor-dot
  Analytics (was Reports): chart-bar
  Compliance: shield-check
  Admin: settings
  Help: life-buoy

4) COMMAND PALETTE
- Add a Cmd/Ctrl+K command palette:
  - Search by screen (Overview, Venues, Strategies, …), by bot/strategy name (use existing local lists), and by Org/Portfolio.
  - Keyboard: arrows to navigate, Enter to go, Esc to close.

5) VISUAL + ACCESSIBILITY POLISH
- Adopt an 8pt spacing scale across header and sidebar.
- Standardize pill/chip styles (28–32px height, 999px radius).
- Ensure all interactive elements (chips, buttons, icons) have hover + focus states and meet WCAG AA contrast.
- Provide “prefers-reduced-motion” friendly transitions (120–160ms fade/slide, no bounce).
- Keep brand red reserved for primary actions, Live mode accents, and critical errors.

6) DON’TS
- Do not change routing paths or API calls.
- Do not alter business logic behind approvals, exports, or health checks.

7) TESTING / DONE CRITERIA
- Keyboard-only navigation works for header chips, filters, and command palette.
- Collapsed sidebar displays correct tooltips and active state.
- All icons render with consistent stroke/size; no mixed filled/outline variants.
- Renamed “Reports” → “Analytics” across sidebar, page title, breadcrumbs.
- Lighthouse a11y score ≥ 95 on the dashboard route.
