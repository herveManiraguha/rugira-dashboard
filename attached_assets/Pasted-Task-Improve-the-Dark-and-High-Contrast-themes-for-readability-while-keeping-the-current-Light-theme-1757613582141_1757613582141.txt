Task
Improve the Dark and High‑Contrast themes for readability while keeping the current Light theme unchanged. Apply the new palettes to every screen (Overview, Venues, Strategies, Backtesting, Bots, Monitoring, Analytics, Compliance, Admin, Tenants, Help).

Brand rules
Keep primary brand red #E10500 exclusively for filled primary actions/accents and overscroll. Do not use brand red as small text on dark surfaces. Keep P&L and status colors as currently defined.

Accessibility

All body text and labels must meet WCAG AA contrast on both dark and high‑contrast themes.

Do not use brand red as small text on dark backgrounds; reserve for filled elements with white text.

Verify focus visibility on buttons, inputs, table rows, and sidebar links.

Acceptance

Sidebars, cards, tables, charts, and alerts are legible at arm’s length on a typical office monitor.

Active navigation is obvious; gridlines and axes are clear; red CTAs pop with white text in both dark and HC modes.

Light theme remains visually unchanged.
