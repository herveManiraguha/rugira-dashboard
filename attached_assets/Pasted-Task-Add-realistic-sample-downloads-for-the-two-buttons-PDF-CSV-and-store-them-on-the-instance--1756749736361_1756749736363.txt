Task: Add realistic sample downloads for the two buttons (PDF + CSV) and store them on the instance

Please create two realistic sample files and wire the existing buttons to download them. Keep them lightweight and clearly labeled as sample / simulated data.

1) File locations (under the public web root)

Create a folder: /public/samples/ (or the equivalent web‑served folder in this project).

Save the files as:

/public/samples/rugira_monthly_performance_report_sample.pdf

/public/samples/rugira_audit_extract_sample.csv

Make sure they are accessible over HTTPS (openable in a new tab if navigated directly).

2) Monthly Performance Report — PDF (≤ 1.5 MB)

Purpose: a board‑ready monthly report showing performance, risk, breakdowns, and charts—based on simulated data.

Document spec (in order):

Cover

Title: “Rugira — Monthly Performance Report (Sample / Simulated Data)”

Period: “Last 12 months ending [current month + year]”

Company: Rugira AG · Zug, Switzerland

Executive Summary (1 page max)

Starting equity: 100’000–

Ending equity: 105’247.32–

Net return: +5.2% (vs last month +2.8%)

Volatility (ann.): 7.9% · Sharpe 1.42 · Max drawdown −8.3%

Trades: 247 · Strategies: 3 · Venues: 5

Today’s P&L: 1’247.83 (USD; keep mixed currency note in footnote)

Footnote: “Simulated data for demonstration; non‑custodial software; no investment advice.”

Performance Overview

Monthly returns table for the last 12 months (values summing realistically to +5.2%).

Cumulative return line.

Charts (generated and embedded)

Equity curve (monthly/every‑few‑days granularity).

Monthly returns bar chart (green/red where appropriate).

Drawdown curve (peak‑to‑trough %).

Risk Metrics & Limits

Daily VaR (simple proxy ok), realized volatility, max single‑day loss, average position size.

Guardrails configured: SL/TP on, daily drawdown cap on, kill‑switch enabled.

“0 risk‑limit breaches” (or 1 demo breach recorded and auto‑halted—state which one you choose).

Breakdowns

By strategy (e.g., Grid +2.1%, Momentum +3.4%, Arb −0.3%) with P&L and hit ratios.

By venue (e.g., Binance 52% notional, Coinbase Pro 28%, OKX 20%) with fees paid.

Trading & Fees Summary

Order count, fill ratio, maker/taker split, effective fees (bps), slippage estimate.

Compliance & Audit

Statement: “All actions are tenant‑scoped, time‑stamped, and exportable; see Audit Extract sample CSV.”

Note on data lineage and UTC timestamps.

Disclaimers & Methodology

Simulated data, no financial advice, non‑custodial execution, figures indicative only.

FX note: values shown in USD/CHF where relevant with single EOD FX policy.

Acceptance: file opens cleanly, text selectable (not just images), charts readable, total size ≤ 1.5 MB, and “Simulated Data” appears on cover and footer.

3) Audit Extract — CSV (200–500 rows, ≤ 500 KB)

Purpose: a compliance‑friendly, tamper‑evident‑style extract mixing orders, fills, and risk events for a single month.

Schema (header row exactly in this order):

timestamp_utc,tenant_id,account_id,venue,market,base,quote,event_type,order_id,client_order_id,parent_order_id,side,order_type,time_in_force,post_only,decision_quote,decision_latency_ms,status,price,qty,quote_qty,trade_id,fill_price,fill_qty,fill_quote,fee,fee_asset,liquidity,slippage_bps,risk_check_passed,risk_reason,kyt_action,prev_hash,curr_hash,day_root


Population rules:

timestamp_utc: ISO‑8601 with milliseconds (e.g., 2025-08-20T10:15:23.145Z) across a recent 30‑day window.

venue: realistic set (e.g., binance, coinbasepro, okx).

market/base/quote: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, SOL/EUR (mixed ok).

event_type: mix of order_submitted, order_acked, filled, cancelled, risk_block, kyt_flag.

order_id/client_order_id: consistent per flow; parent_order_id for child orders if used (blank otherwise).

side: buy|sell; order_type: limit|market; time_in_force: GTC|IOC; post_only: true|false.

decision_quote: mid price snapshot when decision made; decision_latency_ms: 20–900 ms.

status: final status (acked|filled|cancelled|rejected).

price/qty/quote_qty: numeric; make fills plausible relative to market.

trade_id / fill_ / fee / fee_asset / liquidity:* present only on fills; liquidity: maker|taker.

slippage_bps: (VWAP_fill - decision_quote)/decision_quote * 10000 rounded; negative/positive both appear.

risk_check_passed / risk_reason: include a few false with reasons (max_drawdown_cap, position_limit).

kyt_action: allow|review|block (mostly allow, a few review).

prev_hash/curr_hash: compute a simple SHA‑256 chain over the CSV row payload (stringified). First row of each day has prev_hash empty.

day_root: same for all rows of a given day (a fake “Merkle root” placeholder like root_2025-08-20_<hex>).

Acceptance: first row is the header; at least 200 rows; values parse cleanly in a spreadsheet; hash chain fields non‑empty (except first of day); file size ≤ 500 KB.

4) Wire the buttons to these files

“Download Sample Report (PDF)” → href="/samples/rugira_monthly_performance_report_sample.pdf" and set download attribute if used in this codebase.

“Download Sample Extract (CSV)” → href="/samples/rugira_audit_extract_sample.csv" similarly.

5) Small UI/content tweaks

Under each card’s “Sample / Simulated Data” label, add a small note:
“Figures are simulated and for demonstration only. Not investment advice.”

Ensure both links work in a new incognito window and return 200 OK.

6) Deliverables checklist (mark each when done)

 PDF generated and saved at /public/samples/rugira_monthly_performance_report_sample.pdf (≤ 1.5 MB)

 CSV generated and saved at /public/samples/rugira_audit_extract_sample.csv (200–500 rows, ≤ 500 KB)

 Buttons link to the above paths and trigger downloads

 “Simulated Data” disclaimer visible near both buttons

 Manual test in browser: both links download, files open, charts/columns as specified

Please implement exactly as described and keep both artifacts under version control so they persist with the Replit instance.
