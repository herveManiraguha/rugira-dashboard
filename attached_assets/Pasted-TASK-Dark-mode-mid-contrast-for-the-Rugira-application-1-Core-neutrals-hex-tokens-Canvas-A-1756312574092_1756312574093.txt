TASK — Dark mode (mid-contrast) for the Rugira application
1) Core neutrals (hex tokens)

Canvas / App background: #0F1115

Sidebar / Left rail: #0D1117 (slightly darker than canvas)

Top navbar: #0B0E13

Footer: #10131A

Card / Primary surface: #161B22

Sub-surface (table headers, subtle panels): #121722

Input background: #121722

Row/List hover tint: #1B2230 (a touch brighter to read as “lift”)

2) Dividers, borders, focus (visible on poor screens)

Hairline divider (inside cards/rows): #232B36

Card/Panel outer border (1px): #2B3440

Strong divider (section seams, sticky bars): #374150

Navbar bottom rule: #1F2833

Neutral focus ring (for inputs/buttons): #3A66FF (soft glow, not neon)

3) Text neutrals (refined, readable)

Headings / Strong: #F5F7FA

Body / Default: #E3E6EC

Secondary: #C7CFD9

Muted / Meta: #9AA3B2

Disabled: #5E6877

4) Brand & status colors (keep your hues; adjust only tints on dark)

Use your existing brand red/green/blue for lines, icons, and solid buttons. For tinted backgrounds (chips, alerts, subtle states), use darker washes so they read on dark without shouting:

Positive (bg / text / border): #0D2A1E / #8FE3C0 / #1B5E3D

Warning: #2A2313 / #F2D088 / #6B4E16

Error: #2A1412 / #F2A29E / #7D2D2A

Info / Neutral: #121D2E / #9EC5FF / #2C4A7C

5) Where to apply (so contrast is consistent)

App background → #0F1115.

Sidebar → #0D1117; keep icons/text at Secondary or Body levels; active item uses a pale brand-tinted pill on #1B2230.

Top navbar → #0B0E13 with #1F2833 bottom rule.

Cards & stat tiles → #161B22 with #2B3440 outer border and #232B36 internal dividers.

Tables: header cells on #121722, body rows #161B22; row hover #1B2230; gridlines #232B36.

Inputs: background #121722, border #2B3440; focus ring #3A66FF (subtle glow).

Footer: #10131A with a top rule #1F2833; body text #C7CFD9.

6) Buttons & interactive elements

Primary buttons: keep solid brand red with white text; hover slightly brighter red (no neon), focus ring #3A66FF.

Secondary/Outline: surface #161B22, border #2B3440; hover background #1B2230 so outlines don’t vanish.

Ghost/Icon buttons: rest on #161B22; icon/text #E3E6EC; hover #1B2230.

7) Charts (subtle, legible on dark)

Plot area: #161B22

Major gridlines: #293241

Minor gridlines: #1E2633

Axis labels: #A2A9B5

Legend text: #C7CFD9

Series colors stay on brand; the neutral backdrop makes them pop without oversaturation.

8) Overlays, modals, toasts

Modal backdrop: black at ~55–60% opacity (no blur needed).

Modal surface: #161B22 with #2B3440 border; heading #F5F7FA.

Toasts: #161B22 with #2B3440 border; icon uses the status tints above.

9) Shadows & elevation (keep refined)

Use very soft shadows on dark (avoid grey haze). Prefer 1–2px of lift plus the border tokens to suggest layers.

Avoid pure-black shadows; if needed, keep them subtle and transparent.

10) Accessibility & QA checks

Body text on card surface achieves ≥ 4.5:1 contrast.

Secondary text on card surface achieves ≥ 3:1.

Tinted chips keep AA for their text against the provided backgrounds.

At 60% screen brightness, you can clearly distinguish canvas vs sidebar vs navbar vs card without squinting.

Hover states remain obvious (background step to #1B2230 or similar) even with adaptive brightness.
