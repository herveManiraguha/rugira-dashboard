A2. Role‑gated navigation & action guards
Goal: Client RBAC helper (from tenant_roles) with can(view|edit|export) checks per the matrix. Hide/disable controls; tooltip: “Requires Compliance approval” etc.
Acceptance: Viewer cannot start/stop bots/connect venues/export audits; Compliance sees export buttons.

A3. Tenant badge and mode indicator
Goal: Show Tenant + Mode (Paper/Live) in header. In bot forms, default to Paper; render a Paper/Live banner.
Acceptance: Badge shows on all core pages; bot mode change updates banner.

A4. Approvals UX (maker‑checker)
Goal: Approvals drawer/inbox. Users can propose changes (paper→live, risk increase). Approvers see requests and Approve/Reject.
Acceptance: “Awaiting approval” chip appears; approver can approve and requester gets a toast.

A5. Exports & step‑up consent
Goal: Reports/Compliance exports that trigger step‑up modal if backend asks for re‑auth; proceed after confirmation.
Acceptance: Non‑eligible users see disabled export with reason; eligible download with stamped filename.

A6. Sample downloads (Pricing page)
Goal: Link to /samples/rugira_monthly_performance_report_sample.pdf and /samples/rugira_audit_extract_sample.csv. Show Sample/Simulated Data disclaimer.
Acceptance: Both files download (HTTP 200) in incognito; accessible labels and keyboard focus.

A7. Demo data fixtures
Goal: With DEMO_AUTH=true, render venue cards, 6–8 demo bots (varied status), and 2 backtests; badge “Demo data”.
Acceptance: Overview, Bots, Strategies, Backtesting populated; toggle in profile drawer controls visibility.

A8. Bot wizard (paper)
Goal: 3 steps—Strategy → Market & Venue → Risk & Start—enforcing SL/TP, daily DD cap, kill‑switch defaults.
Acceptance: Paper bot goes to Running; invalid/unsafe inputs blocked.

A9. Monitoring screen polish
Goal: Latency tiles (p50/p95), error badges, and a small log tail per bot.
Acceptance: Tiles update every 10 s; error causes render (rate‑limit, auth, risk‑block).

A10. Accessibility & keyboard navigation
Goal: a11y audit—aria‑labels, focus rings, tab order, contrast for light/dark.
Acceptance: Lighthouse a11y ≥ 95 on Overview & Bots; modals Esc‑close and trap focus.

A11. Internal checks page
Goal: /internal/checks showing: no GA before consent, CSP present, demo badge visible, 404 works.
Acceptance: Green checks when OK; page not in main nav.

A12. 404 & empty states
Goal: Branded 404; empty state illustrations for Bots/Strategies when empty.
Acceptance: 404 renders; empty states show in new tenant.

A13. Local config drawer
Goal: (Demo only) Developer drawer to view decoded token (no secrets), roles, tenant, flags.
Acceptance: Drawer shows token claims + feature flags.

A14. Privacy & consent banner
Goal: GA loads only after consent; Privacy Policy link near form.
Acceptance: DevTools shows no GA before Accept; state persists.

A15. Performance hygiene
Goal: Preload key fonts, defer non‑critical scripts, lazy‑load charts.
Acceptance: FCP < 2s on Replit preview; below‑fold charts lazy‑render.
